Although every installation of DomainMOD includes a copy of the User Guide (within the /docs/ folder), the most up-to-date version can always be found [online](https://domainmod.org/docs/userguide/).

**A Work In Progress**  
The User Guide is a work in progress and more documentation will be added as time goes on. Some sections are fairly bare at the moment, as we thought it would be best to at least get *some* documentation created, as opposed to waiting for it to be 100% complete before publishing it. Please bear with us as we continue to expand this guide.
