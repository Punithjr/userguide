DomainMOD is open source and free to use. We're happy to provide the #1 open source domain and internet asset manager completely free of charge, and we hope you find it as useful as we do.

That said, maintaining a project like DomainMOD does have some associated costs, such as web hosting and bandwidth, as well as a considerable amount of time spent developing the software itself. If you feel you have benefited from DomainMOD, and you're able to do so, we would appreciate any contribution you could make. No contribution is too small!
