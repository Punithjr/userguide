Usage
-------

!!! warning "Requirement"
    In order to use the Domain Queue you must first setup the [cron job](getting-started.md#cron-job) that comes with DomainMOD.

1. Click on **Domains** on the main menu.

2. Click the **Add Domains To Queue** button on the Domains page.

3. On the dropdown list, choose the registrar account that you would like to import using the Domain Queue.

4. If requested, paste in a list of the domains you want to add to the Domain Queue. This is not always required, as some domain registrars will retrieve the list of domains from your account automatically.

5. Click the **Add Domains** button.

6. You will now be taken to the Domain Queue page, where you can see the status of your domain imports. You can also access the Domain Queue by clicking on **Queue** on the main menu (this menu option is only available when you have domains being processed in the queue).

7. Once all of your imports have completed you can click the **Clear Completed** button in order to clear the queue.
